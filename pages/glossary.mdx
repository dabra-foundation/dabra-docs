### DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
A decentralized organization that operates based on rules encoded as smart contracts on a blockchain. DAOs are governed by their members through a transparent voting process.

### Proposal
A formal suggestion or plan put forward for consideration by the members of a DAO. Proposals can include changes to the DAO’s operations, allocation of funds, or changes to the governance structure.

### Multisig
A security mechanism requiring multiple signatures to authorize a transaction. This adds a layer of security by preventing a single point of failure.

### Treasury
The collective funds or assets managed by a DAO. The treasury is often used to fund projects, pay contributors, and support the operations of the DAO.

### Quorum
The percentage of votes required for a proposal to pass. This threshold can be set to ensure that a proposal has sufficient support from the community before being enacted.

### Delegation
The process of assigning voting power to another member of the DAO. Delegation allows members to entrust their voting rights to someone they believe will represent their interests.

### Vesting
The process by which tokens are gradually released to their recipients over time. Vesting schedules are used to incentivize long-term commitment and participation in the DAO.

### On-Chain Governance
A governance system where all processes and decisions are recorded and executed on the blockchain. On-chain governance ensures transparency and immutability of the decision-making process.

### Lockup Period
A predetermined period during which tokens, cannot be sold or transferred. Lockup periods are often used to prevent market manipulation and ensure long-term commitment.
