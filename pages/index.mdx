## How can I use Dabra?

For a user to use Dabra in his full capacity there are three main components: DAOs, proposals, and votes. Each DAO is filled with proposals and a treasury linked to it which all proposals get voted.

To create a DAO in Dabra, a Solana wallet is required and a min. of **0.019 SOL**.

Users can then generate proposals and vote within their newly generated DAO. Council token holders can establish rules for proposal creation and voting by setting specific configurations. For instance, users may need to hold a minimum of 1 or 1 million tokens to create proposals depending on the DAO parameters.

## Is Dabra safe?

Dabra was audited by **Ottersec** in 2022.
