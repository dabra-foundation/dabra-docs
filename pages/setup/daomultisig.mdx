# Multi-Signature DAO

## DAO Creation

The **multisig** option is the first and easiest way to create a **DAO**. When you select this option you only need to worry about three things:

1. The name of your **DAO.**
2. The **approval quorum**, that is the minimum amount of yes votes to accept a proposal.
3. People who'll be part of your team, whose will own a **council token**.

Make sure to review all info and **double check** if everything is correct.

After creating the DAO make sure to create a **test proposal** to see if the DAO is running on the correct parameters and to see if proposals can go through the quorum.

### Step 5 - Review

After following these steps, your setup should look similar to the image below. When ready, click **`Create wallet`**. Your wallet will pop up asking for a signature. Approve to create the tokens and deploy the **DAO**​.
