# Governance UI

## Governance UI

You most likely use the web-based UI as the primary point of interaction with the SPL Governance program. Therefore, we will conclude this article with a brief overview of the discussed concepts in the context of the UI.

## Creating a Dabra

When you navigate to [**the Dabra page**](https://app.dabra.app/) , you can see the list of existing daos. Clicking on the **`Create DAO`** button presents you with three options to choose from:

All three options present a walkthrough wizard where different default parameters are predefined, and a different set of parameters has to be provided. The **`Multi-Signature`** wallet option creates a **`Dabra`** where only the council is expected to vote, and the community is not enabled. The **`NFT Community DAO`** option creates a **`Dabra`** where voting power comes from ownership of NFTs. It is a voter weight plugin that provides functionality for voting power calculation. The **`Community Token DAO`** is meant for community-driven **DAOs** where both the **`council`** and **`community`** are enabled.

When a **`Dabra`** is created, the main Dabra configuration page is presented. When you change some config, it is usually done via a configuration page that ends up creating a **`proposal`**. The proposal is a usual way to change the configuration of **`Dabra`** and **`Governance`**.

## Let's discuss the most important parts of the UI

<Steps>
### My governance power

   After connecting the wallet, the user can deposit tokens to the **`Dabra`** and manage their delegation of voting power, withdraw tokens, and check on their created proposals. The **`My Proposals`** button shows proposals that the token owner has voted for, including active and unrelinquished ones. The menu names the _unrelinquished proposals_ as **`Unreleased Proposals`**. To withdraw tokens, the user has to to relinquish all proposals (i.e., the **`Release All`** button). Even for finished proposals, the user has to do the **`unrelinquish`** action to withdraw tokens.

### Params

   This section shows the parameters of the **`Dabra`** and allows for changes. The user can change the configuration of the **`Dabra`** (stored in **`DabraConfigAccount`**) in the top right corner by clicking on **`Config -> Change Config`**. All **`Governance`** instances are listed below, and the voting settings can be changed by clicking on the **`Change Config`** button. There are other tabs on the right side of the list of **`Governance`** instances, including **`Accounts`**, where the user can list all related accounts to the Governance. The **`Accounts`** tab lists the **`native treasury`** wallet, ATA token wallets managed by the governance, and program accounts or a mint, if available.

### DAO Wallets

This section provides a different perspective on the **`Governance`** accounts. Importantly, the user can create a new Governance instance by clicking on the **`New DAO wallet`** button. The list below the button represents the addresses of the **`native treasury`** wallets (every **`Governance`** has one). To add an asset to a wallet, the user can click on the **`Add Asset`** button on the right side. A new token account can be created. The tabs on the right side of the list of **`native treasury`** addresses show a list of processed transactions. The `Rules` tab provides a way to change **`Governance`** parameters (similar to the **`Params`** subpage), and the **`Treasury`** and **`NFTs`** tabs provide information about the assets.

### Programs

This section allows the user to manage the **`upgrade authority`** of programs and do code upgrades. The **`New program`** button creates a new program type **`Governance`** (see _Different types of governances_ â†’ [multi-sig](../setup/daomultisig.mdx), [community token](../setup/daotoken.mdx) & [nft](../setup/daonft.mdx)) and takes over management power for the program.

### New proposal

The last section we will touch on is the **`New proposal`** screen. Here, the user can create a new proposal that can be chosen from a list of common proposals (such as mint token, transfer, etc.) or pass a base64-encoded transaction as a proposal. The switch **`Vote by council`** defines if the proposal will be created as a council or community proposal (a council proposal is voted on only by the council and vice versa). At **`Preview transaction`** button, the user can check the instruction by simulating it. The **`Add proposal`** button then creates a new proposal that is eventually listed on the main configuration page.
