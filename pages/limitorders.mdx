### Step 3 - Choose the token vault corresponding to the market you selected

For example, if you want to buy BONK, choose the token you want to pay with, e.g., USDC. If you want to sell BONK, choose BONK.

### Step 4 - Enter token amount and price

1. Enter the total amount of tokens you want to sell.
2. Enter the price per token.
3. Check if the summary matches what you want to propose.

### Step 5 - Set holdup time

This setting prevents the settlement instruction from executing before the order is filled.

**Recommended:** 15-20 minutes. The setting should depend on the price and liquidity of the selected market.

### Step 6 - Submit proposal

After proposing and voting on your limit order, click the **Execute** button. This places the limit order, and the settlement instruction will be blocked from execution for the duration you set in the previous step.

For example, if you set a 5-minute delay, after waiting 5 minutes, you can settle. If the order was filled within that time, the tokens will be transferred to the treasury.
