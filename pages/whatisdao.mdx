# DAOs

At its simplest, a **decentralized autonomous organization** (**DAO**) is a community with a shared bank account. Members of the **DAO** make decisions in a **transparent** and **decentralized** fashion, with smart contracts executing these decisions.

For instance, a member can create a proposal suggesting an investment of the treasury or a program upgrade. The **DAO** members then come together to vote on the proposal. If a predefined quorum votes for the proposal to pass, the proposal is accepted and and executed by a smart contract.

As a result, the **DAO** structure provides a "flat" organizational structure. Each **DAO** member has a voice in the community and the opportunity to drive the direction of the organization.

## Where to find them?

DAOs are displayed upon visiting Dabra and can primarily be filtered by the search bar and searching for the DAO you wish to visit.

You can access a DAO directly via a link that includes domain name (e.g., https://app.dabra.app/dao/MNDE). Custom domain names for spaces are also supported (bonkedao.com, dao.dabra.app/Deanslist).
