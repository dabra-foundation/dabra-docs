- All fields are optional. Only fill-in the fields that you want to set.
- You will need to enter the source link for the DAO and Banner Images. All formats and sizes are supported.
If you don't have the link, follow the guide here to host your image online: [Image Upload Guide](#step-6---upload-image-guide-optional)

### Step 3 - Review the metadata

- Once you have entered the desired fields, verify all the details on the Review page.
- Make sure that the images are loading on this page, if not then the links are broken. Re-check the links 
if that's the case.
- Choose whether you want to create the `Community` or the `Council` proposal.

### Step 4 - Sign the Transactions

- The wallet pop-up will ask you to sign 4-8 transactions depending upon the metadata configured.

### Step 5 - Pass the proposal
